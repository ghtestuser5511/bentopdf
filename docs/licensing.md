## When Do You Need a Commercial License?

| Use Case                                    | License Required       |
| ------------------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Open-source project with public source code | AGPL-3.0 (Free)        |
| Internal company tool (not distributed)     | AGPL-3.0 (Free)        |
| Proprietary/closed-source application       | **Commercial License** |
| SaaS product without source code disclosure | **Commercial License** |
| Redistributing without AGPL compliance      | **Commercial License** |

## Delivery & Licensing Model

- **No license key is required or provided.** BentoPDF intentionally does not use license keys to streamline deployment and reduce operational friction for users.
- Upon purchase, users receive a ZIP archive containing the complete BentoPDF source code and binaries.
- The source code provided is identical to the code published in our public open-source repository.

## Important Notice on Third-Party Components

::: warning AGPL Components - Not Bundled
BentoPDF **does not bundle** AGPL-licensed processing libraries. The following components are loaded separately by users who configure them via **Advanced Settings**:

| Component       | License  | Status                        |
| --------------- | -------- | ----------------------------- |
| **PyMuPDF**     | AGPL-3.0 | Not bundled - user configured |
| **Ghostscript** | AGPL-3.0 | Not bundled - user configured |
| **CoherentPDF** | AGPL-3.0 | Not bundled - user configured |

**Why are AGPL binaries not included?**

To maintain clear legal separation, BentoPDF does not distribute AGPL-licensed binaries. Users who need features powered by these libraries can:

1. Configure their own WASM sources in Advanced Settings
2. Host their own WASM proxy to serve these files
3. Use any compatible CDN that hosts these packages

This approach ensures:

- BentoPDF's core code remains under its dual-license (AGPL-3.0 / Commercial)
- Users make an informed choice when enabling AGPL features
- Clear compliance boundaries for commercial users
  :::

::: tip Commercial License & AGPL Features
The commercial license covers BentoPDF's own code. If you configure and use AGPL components (PyMuPDF, Ghostscript, CoherentPDF), you must still comply with their respective AGPL-3.0 license terms, which may require source code disclosure if you distribute modified versions.

## FAQ

### Do I need a license key to use BentoPDF?

No. BentoPDF does not use license keys. The commercial license grants you legal rights to use the software in proprietary applications.

### Can I use BentoPDF in my SaaS product?

Yes, with a commercial license. Without it, you must comply with AGPL-3.0, which requires you to make your full source code available to users.

### What about the AGPL components?

Components like CoherentPDF are licensed under AGPL v3 and remain under that license. The commercial license covers BentoPDF's own code but does not override third-party AGPL obligations.

### How do I get an invoice?

Email [contact@bentopdf.com](mailto:contact@bentopdf.com) with your Ko-fi purchase confirmation, and we'll send an official invoice.
