            ## CLA Signature Required
            
            Thank you for your contribution! Before we can accept your pull request, you need to sign our [Contributor License Agreement (CLA)](https://github.com/${{ github.repository }}/blob/main/ICLA.md).
            
            ### Why do we need a CLA?
            
            BentoPDF uses a dual licensing model (AGPL-3.0 for open source + commercial license). The CLA allows us to:
            - Include your contributions in both open source and commercial versions
            - Protect you and us legally
            - Keep the project sustainable
            
            ### How to sign
            
            To sign the CLA, please comment on this PR with:
            
            ```
            I have read the CLA Document and I hereby sign the CLA
            ```
            
            **For corporate contributions**, please have your organization sign our [Corporate CLA (CCLA)](https://github.com/${{ github.repository }}/blob/main/CCLA.md) by contacting us at contact@bentopdf.com.
            
            ---
            
            ⚠️ **Note**: You only need to sign the CLA once. Future contributions to this repository will not require re-signing.
